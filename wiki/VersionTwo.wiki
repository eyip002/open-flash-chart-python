#summary Crude details about the this library (version 2.10) I wrote for version 2 (JÃ¶rmungandr) of Open Flash Chart.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Version 2.10 of this library was re-written from scratch to be much easier to use.  It removes the need to call functions when adding chart attributes and makes for an intuitive usage.  The library is also significantly smaller than previous versions.

This library takes the liberty of assuming the programmer is `*`smart`*`. 

= Details =
The most important file is called *OpenFlashChart.py*

*To use the library:*
{{{
from OpenFlashChart import Chart
}}}

All chart types/varieties should be supported:
{{{
 - Line
 + Line Dot
 + Line Hollow
 - Bar
 + Bar Filled
 + Bar Glass
 + Bar 3D
 + Bar Sketch
 + Bar Horizontal
 - Bar Stack
 + Area
 + Area Hollow
 + Pie
 + Scatter
 + Scatter Line
 + Radar
 + Shapes
}}}

Chart elements:
{{{
 - Title
 - X axis legend
 - Y axis legend
 - X axis
 - Y axis
 + Y axis (right)
 + X axis labels
 - Background colour
 + Click events
 + Floating bars
 - Tooltip
}}}



=Demonstration:=
I also wrote my own *Demo.py* script to demonstrate the use of the Python library.  I also got some of the JavaScript features going as well.  Like the calling of a JavaScript function using on_click and loading new JSON data using load() defined in the ActionScript.  (Uses Cherrypy)

To run the demonstration, *cherrypy* and either *json* or *cjson* are required.
  * *json* is provided by Python 2.6 and 3.0.
  * "CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented HTTP framework." It can be found at http://cherrypy.org .
  * cjson is a "Fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python."  It can be found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cjson.
