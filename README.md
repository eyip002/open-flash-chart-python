# OpenFlashChart Python Library

This project aims to provide a Python library for creating the data strings required by Open Flash Chart to render graphs.

Python version 2.5 or later is required (limited testing with Python 3.0).  I haven't had a chance to test the latest version on Python 2.4.

Open Flash Chart is an interactive chart viewer written in ActionScript.  Open Flash Chart is an open source project.  At the minimum, Open Flash Chart version 1 requires Adobe Flash Player version 8 while Open Flash Chart version 2 requires Adobe Flash Player 9.

  * Open Flash Chart 1 uses comma delimited strings.
  * Open Flash Chart 2 uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

[VersionOne](VersionOne.md) and [VersionTwo](VersionTwo.md) provide a short description of the libraries for version 1 and 2 of Open Flash Chart.

The change log for both versions can be found in the Wiki: [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md)

Very short tutorials can be found in the Wiki: [Tutorial](Tutorial.md)
